# Cat vs Dog Classification using CNN
## Overview
This project demonstrates the use of a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** to classify images of cats and dogs. The model is trained on a dataset of labeled images of cats and dogs, with the goal of predicting whether a given image contains a cat or a dog. The model is trained for 10 epochs, achieving a balance between training time and classification accuracy.

This project is a simple example of image classification, using deep learning techniques and Keras with **TensorFlow** backend.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project consists of images of cats and dogs. It is a popular dataset used for binary classification tasks and can be found in various online repositories (such as Kaggle).

For this project, the data is split into two main directories:

**train/**: Contains the training images (both cats and dogs).
**test/**: Contains the testing images (both cats and dogs).
Each image is labeled as either cat or dog based on the folder name, which is used to assign labels during model training.

## Model Architecture
The model is based on a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture, which is well-suited for image classification tasks. The CNN model consists of several layers:

**Convolutional Layer**: Extracts features from the input image using filters.
**Max Pooling Layer**: Reduces the spatial dimensions of the image.
**Flatten Layer**: Flattens the pooled feature map into a single vector.
**Fully Connected Layer**: A dense layer that outputs a prediction for the classification.
**Output Layer**: Uses a sigmoid activation to output a probability score between 0 and 1, which is then used to classify the image as either a cat or a dog.
The model is trained for 10 epochs, with the goal of achieving high accuracy in distinguishing between cats and dogs.

## Model Architecture:
python
Copy code
**from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Conv2D, MaxPooling2D, Flatten, Dense, Dropout

model = Sequential([
    Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(150, 150, 3)),
    MaxPooling2D(2, 2),
    Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu'),
    MaxPooling2D(2, 2),
    Flatten(),
    Dense(128, activation='relu'),
    Dropout(0.5),
    Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accurac**y'])

## Key Layers:
**Conv2D**: Convolutional layers with ReLU activation to extract features from images.
**MaxPooling2D**: Max-pooling layers for down-sampling the feature maps.
**Flatten**: Converts the 2D feature map into a 1D vector.
**Dense**: Fully connected layers to make the final prediction.
**Dropout**: Regularization technique to prevent overfitting.

## Training
The model is trained on the dataset using the Adam optimizer and binary cross-entropy loss function. The training process consists of:

**Epochs**: The model is trained for 10 epochs, which involves feeding the training data through the model 10 times.
**Batch Size**: A batch size of 32 is used for updating the weights after processing a batch of images.
**Training Data**: The training dataset consists of labeled images of cats and dogs.

## Results
During the training process, the model's accuracy and loss are tracked for each epoch. A plot of the accuracy and loss can be generated to visualize the model's performance over the epochs.


This graph will help you understand how the model's accuracy and loss change as it trains over the 10 epochs.

## Usage
Once trained, the model can be used to classify new images of cats and dogs. The model outputs a probability between 0 and 1, with values closer to 0 indicating the image is more likely to be a cat, and values closer to 1 indicating the image is more likely to be a dog.

## Installation
To run this project, you need to install the following dependencies:

**TensorFlow** (for building and training the CNN model)
**Keras** (high-level API for TensorFlow)
**Matplotlib** (for visualizing training progress)
**NumPy **(for numerical operations)
You can install the required libraries using pip:

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the application of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for binary image classification. The model is trained on a dataset of cats and dogs, achieving good classification performance after 10 epochs of training. By leveraging deep learning techniques, the model can effectively classify new images as either a cat or a dog, making it a simple yet powerful example of image classification.
